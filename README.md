# Python üêç

This repository contains Python scripts that I've written while learning Python. Each script is a representation of the concepts and skills I've learned throughout my learning journey.

## Repository Contents

1. `hello.py`: The first program everyone writes! This script simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. `variables_and_types.py`: This script includes examples of variables and different data types in Python.
3. `control_flow.py`: This script showcases control flow elements in Python like if-else statements and for/while loops.
4. `functions.py`: This script contains examples of how to define and use functions in Python.
5. `classes.py`: This script includes basic examples of classes, objects, and Object-Oriented Programming.
6. `error_handling.py`: This script provides examples of how to handle errors and exceptions in Python.
7. `file_io.py`: Demonstrates how to read and write files in Python.
8. `libraries_and_modules.py`: Some examples of importing and using Python libraries and modules.
   
   ... and many more!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run this scripts:

```
Python 3.8+
```

### Installing

1. Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/nkhalil98/python.git`

2. Run each python file separately. For example, `python3 hello.py`

## Running the tests

Each Python script can be run from the command line with the `python3` command. For example, to run `hello_world.py`, navigate to its location and run `python3 hello_world.py`.
