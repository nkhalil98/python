# shell sort is an optimization over insertion sort as insertion sort requires many swaps and comparisons if heavy elements are located towards the end of sorted array being built
# shell sort will initially sort subarrays of elements that are equal distance (gap) apart
# we keep on reducing the gap until it is 1. then this happens, shell sort becomes insertion sort and will carry with less comparisons and swaps
# shell sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n(log(n))^2)
# shell sort has a space complexity of O(1)
# shell sort has a best-case time complexity of Î©(nlog(n))
